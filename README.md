- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hippihalo
- 👀 I’m interested in finding out what went wrong with learning computers as a developing mind and actually using this stuff as an adult.  I taught myself html one Summer on dial up just to better use GirlSpace and now look at you slack jawed if you use one too many (two...sometimes one) tech words!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about plants...better UI with less hair pulling.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on better UI for the simpleton (i.e. me)...I can give insight on how my mind approaches something but lack of interest tells me either the devs that be cannot fathom the conceptual gap in understanding or they just dont care, and I will revert back to the mighty pen and paper and live in the woods until the AI takeover fully saturates the Earth and overcomes me.
- 📫 How to reach me...carrier pigeon may soon be the best method.  Otherwise, hippihalo@outlook.com or my OnlyFans page, lol.
- 😄 Pronouns: Apparently not the correct response but ME, MYSELF AND I  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I AM funny...if you can decode my humor and put up with my idiosyncrasies long enough to see
